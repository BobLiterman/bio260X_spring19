## Assignment Description  
The repeating schedule blocks for this class are set up into six sets of two classes. During the first class, students will hear a seminar-style talk. In the following week, instructors and students will have a follow-up discussion to not only answer specific questions about the talk, but also to put the findings in a larger context.  

# After the follow-up discussion and before the next speaker, students will turn in a response (minimum 250 words) that addresses:  

1. A succinct summary of the research presented  
2. A brief description of how computational tools were used to address the speakersâ€™ questions  
3. A short statement about follow-up research that the student would be personally interested in learning about.
