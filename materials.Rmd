### Week 6 Discussion Notes
#### Speaker: Christina Hernandez  (WHOI/MIT)

#### Research Summary:
- Source of the  model parameters?
- Running simulations multiple times to sort  out randomness
- Particle Backtracking: Combining models of ocean current and end point of imaginary particles to simulate possible origin points
- What are the particles?
- Imagine a  computer simulation of how the ocean moves, like a movie of the ocean
- The computer can imagine dropping MANY  tiny  little beads into a spot on the water, and  mapping their route based on the model of ocean currents

#### Further Research:
- What explains the robustness of the larval tuna in  years with drastically different climate conditions?
- What are the tolerances of larval tuna?
- Do environmental conditions buffer larvae from extreme conditions?
- What defines a good catch zone? How important  is having longer term data?
- Longer-term study with an aim towards  redefining the protected zone
- Physical surveys looking for adult tuna spawning behavior
- Common garden to test ideal spawning conditions
