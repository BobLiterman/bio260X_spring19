## Overview
This course is intended to introduce students to how local working scientists ask and answer contemporary questions in biology. Students will hear talks from New England-area researchers on a variety of topics. In addition to the biological findings, in Spring 2019 our speakers will also highlight how learning computational skills has enabled them to better address their questions. Question-and-Answer sessions will give students the opportunity to ask both broad and specific questions as it relates to the speakers' research path.

## Course Goals
At the end of this course students enrolled in BIO260X should...

* Be exposed to cutting edge biological research across many fields through direct contact with working scientists
* See various examples on how learning computational skills can facilitate scientific discovery

## Student Learning Outcomes
At the end of this course students enrolled in BIO260X should be able to...

* Discuss how scientists answer contemporary biological questions
* Explain the application of computational tools to solve biological problems
